## Description 
Motivation for building the portfolio was to become more familiar with how the React language works. The project was built with intention to be able to be served as an exposee of projects made through a portfolio. Making a portfolio through React absolves the issue of the need for more intensive DOM manipulation and inefficient targeting and rerendering of simpler html pages. Concepts learned through this creation include learning of React components, pages, and even form field authentication.
