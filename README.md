## Description 
Motivation for the project was brought about by the desire to learn how to integrate graphql to a MERN stack to simplify the front end. The project was built to explore the capabilities of the Apollo server as well as using the GraphQL API to interact with our Mongoose database in a more flexible way. Concepts learned in the development of the app include learning about how the afforementioned programs' packages help to simplify the way that users perform queries, as well as how to set up different routes for development and even learning more about how applications are deployed.
